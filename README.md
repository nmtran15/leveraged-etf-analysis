# Leveraged ETF Performance Analysis

This project investigates the long-term performance of 3x leveraged ETFs relative to their underlying indices, with a focus on the effects of volatility drag and compounding. It combines financial theory with Python-based analysis to explore how market conditions influence the returns of leveraged products such as SPXL, TQQQ, and others.

## 📌 Objectives

- Analyze the divergence between leveraged ETFs and their benchmarks during trending and oscillating markets
- Quantify the impact of volatility decay on cumulative returns
- Evaluate the suitability of leveraged ETFs for different investor profiles

## 📊 Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: Core analysis and data processing
- **pandas / numpy**: Data manipulation and numerical operations
- **yfinance**: Historical price data retrieval
- **matplotlib / seaborn**: Data visualization

## 📁 Project Structure

- `/notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks with code for performance analysis and visualizations
- `/data`: Contains cleaned historical price data (if provided)
- `/docs`: Written research report summarizing key insights and implications for investors

## 📈 Key Insights

- Leveraged ETFs do not deliver 3x the returns of their benchmarks over longer periods due to volatility drag
- In oscillating markets, performance decay is significantly more pronounced
- During clear upward or downward trends, leveraged ETFs more closely track their theoretical multiple
